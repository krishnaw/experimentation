# Experimentation Platform

AI-native A/B testing demo. Chat with an AI agent to create experiments, flip feature flags, and analyze results — entirely in natural language.

Built on two demo apps where feature flags and experiments control product layouts, sort order, and UI sections live:
- **DemoApp1** — Electronics e-commerce store (tech products, grid layouts)
- **DemoApp2** — Grocery Shop homepage (hero carousel, category grid, 19 weekly deals, collapsible footer)

## Architecture

```
Single Next.js App (:3050)
  ├── /             — DemoApp1 e-commerce store (Exp Engine SDK, client-side flags)
  ├── /demoapp2     — DemoApp2 Grocery Shop replica (Exp Engine SDK, client-side flags)
  ├── /dashboard    — Control Room (split-panel: context + chat)
  │   └── /api/chat ─── Vercel AI SDK ─── Cerebras / Mistral / Groq / Anthropic
  │         └── Exp Engine REST API (:3100)
  ├── /growthbook   — Exp Engine UI (embedded iframe)
  └── /api/*        — Next.js API routes (chat, health, products, demoapp2/*)

Exp Engine (:3000 UI, :3100 API) — powered by GrowthBook ←── MongoDB (:27017)
```

> **What is Exp Engine?** "Exp Engine" is our branding for GrowthBook — the open-source feature flagging and A/B testing platform that powers the experimentation backend. All SDK, API, and Docker references use GrowthBook under the hood; "Exp Engine" is the user-facing name throughout this app.

## What You Can Do

Type natural language into the chat at `/dashboard` to control your experimentation stack:

```
"List all running experiments"
"Create an experiment called Hero Banner Test with Control and Variant A"
"What feature flags are active?"
"Create a boolean feature flag called show-promo-banner with default true"
"Get results for experiment exp_xxx"
```

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+ and **pnpm** (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- **Docker Desktop** (for GrowthBook + MongoDB)
- **At least one LLM API key:**

  | Provider   | Speed    | Cost      | Sign up at              |
  |------------|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
  | Cerebras   | Fastest  | Free tier | cloud.cerebras.ai       |
  | Mistral    | Fast     | Free tier | console.mistral.ai      |
  | Groq       | Fast     | Free tier | console.groq.com        |
  | Anthropic  | Reliable | Paid      | console.anthropic.com   |

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd experimentation
pnpm install
```

### 2. Start Exp Engine (GrowthBook)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Opens Exp Engine UI at http://localhost:3000. Create your admin account on first run.

### 3. Get your Exp Engine keys

1. **Settings → API Keys** → create a Secret key (starts with `secret_`)
2. **SDK Connections** → New Connection → copy the Client key (starts with `sdk-`)

### 4. Configure environment

```bash
cp env.example apps/web/.env.local
```

Fill in:

```bash
GROWTHBOOK_SECRET_API_KEY=secret_xxx        # from step 3
NEXT_PUBLIC_GROWTHBOOK_CLIENT_KEY=sdk-xxx   # from step 3
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=xxx                        # at least one LLM key
```

### 5. Create feature flags

In the Exp Engine UI (http://localhost:3000), go to **Features** and create:

| Feature Key                | Type    | Default  | Controls                             |
|----------------------------|---------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| `product-card-layout`      | string  | `grid`   | DemoApp1: product grid vs large-image layout |
| `featured-section-enabled` | boolean | `true`   | DemoApp1: show/hide Best Sellers section |
| `product-sort-order`       | string  | `popularity` | DemoApp1: product sort: popularity or price |
| `demoapp2-hero-layout`     | string  | `carousel` | DemoApp2: hero carousel vs static banner |
| `demoapp2-fresh-section`   | boolean | `true`   | DemoApp2: show/hide "Shop What's Fresh" |
| `demoapp2-deals-sort`      | string  | `popularity` | DemoApp2: weekly deals sort order |

Make sure each flag is **enabled** in your environment (SDK Connections → environment).

### 6. Start the app

```bash
pnpm dev:web   # http://localhost:3050
```

Visit:
- http://localhost:3050 — DemoApp1 (electronics store) with live feature flags
- http://localhost:3050/demoapp2 — DemoApp2 (Grocery Shop) with live feature flags
- http://localhost:3050/dashboard — Control Room (chat)
- http://localhost:3050/growthbook — Exp Engine UI (embedded)

## Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (Vitest, no servers needed) — 161 tests (160 pass + 1 skipped)
pnpm test

# Integration tests (Playwright + Vitest, mocked externals)
pnpm test:integration

# E2E tests (Playwright headless, requires :3050 + Exp Engine :3100) — 4 tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Demo scenario tests (requires :3050 + :3100 + LLM API keys)
pnpm test:demo
```

## LLM Fallback Chain

The chat endpoint tries providers in order (first with a valid key wins):

1. **Cerebras** — gpt-oss-120b, fastest, free tier
2. **Mistral** — mistral-small-latest / mistral-medium-latest, free tier
3. **Groq** — llama-3.3-70b-versatile, fast, free tier
4. **Anthropic** — Claude Haiku 4.5, most reliable, paid (rate-limited)

## Demo Scenarios

Good prompts for a live demo:

1. **Flip a layout** — "Create a string feature flag called product-card-layout with default value large-image" → DemoApp1 shows large cards after reload
2. **Toggle a section** — "Create a boolean feature flag called featured-section-enabled with default true" → Best Sellers section appears in DemoApp1
3. **Run an experiment** — "Create an experiment called Hero Banner Test with Control and Variant A"
4. **Check status** — "What feature flags are active?" / "List all running experiments"
5. **API-side flag** — Hit http://localhost:3050/api/products to see sort order change when `product-sort-order` flag changes

## Stopping

```bash
# Stop dev server: Ctrl+C in terminal

# Stop Exp Engine + MongoDB
docker compose down

# Delete all experiment data too
docker compose down -v
```
